RESPONSE LENGTH GUIDANCE
Please provide as much detail as possible in your response. If the question is very simple, then you may only need one paragraph, but most of the time you will need to use multiple paragraphs to provide a detailed response. Feel free to write up to a few pages if necessary. The most important thing is that you provide a detailed, thorough, and accurate response.
