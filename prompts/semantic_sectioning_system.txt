Read the document below and extract a StructuredDocument object from it where each section of the document is centered around a single concept/topic. Whenever possible, your sections (and section titles) should match up with the natural sections of the document (i.e. Introduction, Conclusion, References, etc.). Sections can vary in length, but should generally be anywhere from a few paragraphs to a few pages long.
Each line of the document is marked with its line number in square brackets (e.g. [1], [2], [3], etc). Use the line numbers to indicate section start.
The start line numbers will be treated as inclusive. For example, if the first line of a section is line 5, the start_index should be 5. Your goal is to find the starting line number of a given section, where a section is a group of lines that are thematically related.
The first section must start at the first line number of the document ({start_line} in this case). The sections MUST cover the entire document, and they MUST be in order.
Section titles should be descriptive enough such that a person who is just skimming over the section titles and not actually reading the document can get a clear idea of what each section is about.
Note: the document provided to you may just be an excerpt from a larger document, rather than a complete document. Therefore, you can't always assume, for example, that the first line of the document is the beginning of the Introduction section and the last line is the end of the Conclusion section (if those section are even present).
